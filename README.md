# Rosetta Home 2.0

Rosetta Home 2.0 is an open source Apache 2.0 licensed home automation system built with security and privacy in mind. This means it has an offline first mentality, no internet required. Cloud connectivity is optional for data backup and more in-depth data analysis. You are not locked into any one cloud provider, as we offer support for multiple backends.

It offers a zero-configuration installation, meaning it will attempt to auto-discover as many devices on your network as possible. The system works with a plethora of consumer products for lighting, HVAC, media playback, energy monitoring and weather stations. It also works with [CRT Labs](https://crtlabs.org) open source [IEQ (Indoor Environmental Quality) sensors](https://github.com/NationalAssociationOfRealtors/PiAQ).

The system itself runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and utilizes several USB dongles to communicate with a multitude of devices. Network connectivity is provided over WiFi or ethernet.

Here are some early screen shots of the product while in development.
